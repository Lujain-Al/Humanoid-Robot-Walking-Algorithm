# Humanoid-Robot-Walking-Algorithm

1.Initialize Sensors and Actuators
  - Calibrate sensors (gyroscope, accelerometer, etc.).
  - Initialize joint positions and set to a neutral standing position.


2.Set Walking Parameters
  - Define step length, step height, and walking speed.
  - Determine the center of mass (CoM) position.


3.Start Walking Loop
  - While walking is active:
     1-Check Balance
       - Use sensors to determine the current balance state.
       - If out of balance, adjust torso and limb positions to regain stability.
     2-Lift Leg
      - Select the leg to lift based on the walking pattern (e.g., alternating legs).
      - Raise the selected leg by bending the knee and lifting the thigh.
     3-Move Leg Forward
      - Extend the leg forward while maintaining hip stability.
      - Ensure the foot is positioned correctly to land in front of the CoM.
     4-Lower Leg
      - Gradually lower the foot to the ground.
      - Ensure the foot lands flat to provide stability.
     5-Shift Weight
      - Shift the robot's weight onto the newly planted foot.
      - Use actuators in the torso to maintain balance during the transition.
     6-Repeat for Other Leg
      - Repeat steps 2-5 for the opposite leg.
     7-Adjust for Terrain
      - Use sensors to detect terrain type (flat, inclined, uneven).
      - Adjust step height and width based on terrain feedback.
     8-Monitor for Obstacles
      - Continuously scan for obstacles in the walking path.
      - If an obstacle is detected, modify the walking path or stop.

4.End Walking Motion
  - Gradually reduce speed until the robot comes to a stop.
  - Return to a neutral standing position.


# Additional Considerations
  - Feedback Mechanism: Implement feedback loops to adjust movements based on sensor data.
  - Energy Efficiency: Optimize the algorithm for minimal energy consumption.
  - Safety Protocols: Include emergency stop mechanisms for unexpected situations.
